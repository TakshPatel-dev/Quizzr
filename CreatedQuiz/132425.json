Laravel Echo creates a JavaScript framework for subscribing to channels on the client side. Broadcast drivers (like Pusher or Socket.io) handle WebSocket connections and message distribution. Presence channels track user connections with authentication. This approach delivers true real-time updates without polling overhead, maintains user-specific channel authorization, provides presence awareness of which users are online, integrates seamlessly with Laravel's event system, and creates a scalable real-time architecture that works efficiently even with many connected users.","tip":null,"tags":[{"name":"Laravel"}],"category":"Laravel","difficulty":"Hard"},"1":{"id":10202,"question":"A Laravel application needs to implement a secure authentication system with multi-factor authentication (MFA). Which approach would be most secure?","description":"Implementing secure multi-factor authentication in Laravel.","answers":{"answer_a":"Extend Laravel's built-in auth with an additional password field","answer_b":"Implement time-based one-time passwords with secure storage and rate limiting","answer_c":"Send authentication codes via email only","answer_d":"Use basic HTTP authentication with strong passwords","answer_e":null,"answer_f":null},"multiple_correct_answers":"false","correct_answers":{"answer_a_correct":"false","answer_b_correct":"true","answer_c_correct":"false","answer_d_correct":"false","answer_e_correct":"false","answer_f_correct":"false"},"correct_answer":null,"explanation":"Time-based one-time passwords (TOTP) with secure storage and rate limiting provide the most secure MFA implementation. TOTP generates temporary codes that expire quickly, preventing replay attacks. Secure storage of MFA secrets (encrypted in the database) protects against data breaches. Rate limiting prevents brute force attacks against the verification endpoint. This comprehensive approach implements true multi-factor authentication (something you know and something you have), follows industry standards like RFC 6238, prevents various attack vectors including phishing and credential stuffing, and creates a robust authentication system suitable for applications with strict security requirements.","tip":null,"tags":[{"name":"Laravel"}],"category":"Laravel","difficulty":"Hard"},"2":{"id":10185,"question":"An e-commerce Laravel application needs to process high volumes of orders while ensuring data consistency.

Transactions ensure that all parts of an order (inventory updates, payment records, order details) are processed atomically - either all succeed or all fail. Adding deadlock retry logic (which can be implemented with DB::transaction's retry parameter) automatically handles situations where concurrent orders might cause deadlocks, by retrying the transaction after a brief delay. This approach maintains data consistency even under high concurrency, prevents partial order processing, and creates a reliable foundation for e-commerce operations that must maintain accurate inventory and order records.","tip":null,"tags":[{"name":"Laravel"}],"category":"Laravel","difficulty":"Hard"},"3":{"id":10235,"question":"A Laravel application needs to implement robust handling of external API calls.

Dedicated HTTP clients with consistent interfaces abstract communication details. Retry logic automatically attempts failed requests with backoff strategies. Circuit breakers prevent cascade failures when external services are unavailable. This comprehensive approach handles transient failures gracefully without developer intervention, prevents external service problems from bringing down the application, provides consistent timeout and error handling across all external calls, optimizes connection usage with persistent clients, and creates a resilient communication layer between the application and external dependencies.","tip":null,"tags":[{"name":"Laravel"}],"category":"Laravel","difficulty":"Hard"},"quizMetaData":{"createdBy":"18656047691","difficulty":"hard","topic":"laravel","totalQuestions":"4","createdAt":"26/04/2025\t15:55:39","description":"Laravel Quiz","time":"30"}}
