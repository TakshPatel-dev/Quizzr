Query analysis identifies which queries would benefit most from indexing, focusing effort where it matters. Compound indexes support multiple query patterns and sort operations. This strategic approach improves query performance for actual application usage patterns, balances performance gains against index maintenance costs, addresses specific bottlenecks identified through monitoring, optimizes for common query patterns including sorts and joins, and creates a performant database structure without the overhead of excessive, unused indexes that would slow down write operations.","tip":null,"tags":[{"name":"Laravel"}],"category":"Laravel","difficulty":"Medium"},"4":{"id":10187,"question":"A team is building a Laravel application with complex authorization requirements spanning multiple user roles and permissions.

Policy classes organize authorization logic by resource type (e.g., PostPolicy, CommentPolicy), creating clear separation of concerns. Gate facades offer a consistent API for permission checks throughout the application. Permission-based middleware enables route-level authorization that prevents unauthorized requests from even reaching controllers. This approach centralizes authorization logic, makes permission requirements explicit, enables reuse across the application, simplifies testing, and creates a scalable authorization system that can grow with increasing application complexity.","tip":null,"tags":[{"name":"Laravel"}],"category":"Laravel","difficulty":"Medium"},"5":{"id":2121,"question":"What is Laravel's Request Lifecycle?","description":"Understanding Laravel's application flow.","answers":{"answer_a":"The time a request takes to process","answer_b":"The sequence of steps Laravel takes to process an HTTP request and generate a response","answer_c":"The server request handling","answer_d":"The route processing time","answer_e":null,"answer_f":null},"multiple_correct_answers":"false","correct_answers":{"answer_a_correct":"false","answer_b_correct":"true","answer_c_correct":"false","answer_d_correct":"false","answer_e_correct":"false","answer_f_correct":"false"},"correct_answer":null,"explanation":"The Request Lifecycle in Laravel describes the journey of an HTTP request through your application, from initial entry through middleware, to routing, controller handling, and finally returning a response.
